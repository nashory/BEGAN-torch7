# BEGAN-torch7
Torch7 implementation of BEGAN: Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Networks

__Note that this project is in progress__



## Results so far

+ training is unstable yet. It seems to converge at the very early stage, but finally diverge in the end.
+ The max value of kt set as 0.01 due to avoiding modal collapse (the paper used 1.0)
